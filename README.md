# Aftermath, a Terraria Mod

This is a mod for Terraria that I've made for fun and for practice. Lots of help was gathered from the tModLoader ExampleMod. 

As this is a project for fun I don't have any guarantees for continued additions or new features. There will also be a lot of personal references and inside jokes within.
The name of the mod itself is a (slight) reference to the song Mirror by Porter Robinson: 

"Well, you were the aftermath

Of every judgement

So cold by the sweat that

You'll waste away"
